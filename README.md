# super-pong-nes
Pong game for the NES. Compiles to iNES ROM file. 

This is currently a work in progress! Many features are missing and there will be bugs. Please report them if you happen
to find any! 

## Assembly
This is written for the cc65 development suite, and requires ca65 and ld65 in order to build. 
`compile.bat` currently contains a very primitive build script, but this is intended to be replaced
with a more robust makefile in the future.
